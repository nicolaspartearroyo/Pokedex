# Pokedex App

Objective

To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.

User Goals

Write a small Pokédex app to
display a list of Pokémon.

Key Features

● Load data from an external source (API)
● View a list of items
● On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item

Technical Requirements

● The app must load data from an external API; for instance, the Pokémon API.
● The app must display a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.
● The app must enable the viewing of more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on
demand, such as when clicking on a list item.
● The app must have CSS styling.
● The JavaScript code must be formatted according to ESLint rules.
○ The JavaScript code may be formatted via Prettier.
○ The JavaScript code may be manually formatted.
● The app must use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details or
touch interactions.
○ The app may allow searching for items (e.g., searching for Pokémon).
● The app must not throw any errors when being used.
● The app should be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages (you can
review how to do this in Intro to Frontend Development's Exercise 10: Code Quality, Testing, &
Web Hosting).
● The app must work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.

Nice to Have:

● The app should show loading indicators while loading data.
● The app should handle errors (such as trying to load data while offline) and show user-friendly
error messages.
